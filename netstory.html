<h1>Nightmare</h1>
<br>

<p>For this project, I wanted to go for a never-ending nightmare, almost similar to a maze.  </p>
<p>You want to escape but every decisions needs like endless loop. Was there ever an option to leave in the first place?
 </p>
 <p>There are two "final endings" to end the loop but there is only one pathway there. In addition, I wanted the music </p>
 <p>to repeat on every page to create an entrapping feeling of where everything feels the same. There are some special music for special events.</p>
